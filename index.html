				<h1>History and Discovery</h1>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col">
						<br><br>
						<ul>
							<li>In 1801 Thomas Young was able to offer some very strong evidence to support the wave model of light.</li>
							<li>He placed a screen that had two slits cut into it in front of a monochromatic light.</li>
							<li>The results of Young's Double Slit Experiment should be very different if light is a wave or a particle.</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<div class="col-sm-3"><img src='images/young.jpg'></div>
				</div>
				<div class="row">
					<h3>Theory to Date</h3>
					<div class="col">
						<p>If set up our screen and shine a bunch of monochromatic light onto it.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Light only has particle-like properties, so only the couple of rays of light that hit exactly where the slits are will be able to pass through. </li>
							<ul>
								<li>Imagine it as being almost as though we are spraying paint from a spray can through the openings. </li>
							</ul>
							<li>Since they are little particles they will make a pattern of two exact lines on the viewing screen. </li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<div class="col-sm-5"><img src='images/particle.gif'></div>

				<div class="row">
					<h3>Results of the Double Slit Experiment</h3>
					<div class="col">
						<p>The actual results of the experiment were very different. Light exhibited wave-like properties when shone through the two slits.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>There are still only two light rays that actually go through the slits, but as soon as they pass through they start to diffract. </li>
							<li>Remember, diffraction is when light passes through a small opening and starts to spread out. This will happen from both openings. </li>
							<li>Notice that at some points the two sets of waves will meet crest to crest, at other spots crest meets trough.</li>
						</ul>

					<h3>Calculations</h3>
					<div class="col">
						<p>When you set up this sort of an apparatus, there is actually a way for you to calculate where the bright lines (called fringes) will appear.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>There is always a middle line, which is the brightest. We call it the central fringe. </li>
							<li>The variable “n” is used to count of how many bright fringes you are away from the central fringe. </li>
							<ul>
								<li>The central fringe is n = 0.</li>
								<li>The fringe to either side of the central fringe has an order of n = 1 (the first order fringe).</li>
								<li>The order of the next fringe out on either side is n = 2 (the second order fringe).</li>
								<li>And so on, as shown in the image to the right. </li>
							</ul>

					<h3>Single Slit Differences</h3>
					<div class="col">
						<p>After Young discovered this phenomenon, it was discovered that the diffraction of light through slits is also exhibited with single slits, however, 
							rather than two distinct waves emitting from the two distinct slits, the particles that make up the incoming wave each create their own wave front 
							which then interact with each other according to Huygen's Principle.

					<h1>Single Slit Simulation Information</h1>
					<p>This is a simulation the diffraction of electromagnetic waves in and around the visible range of the human eye. The simulation shows the waves hitting the slit, the folding of these waves, and the image produced on the screen. The intensity as a function of angle is also plotted behind the screen. The simulation takes place with a single slot, and allows you to change the values ​​of three key parameters:</p>
					<table>
						<tr>
							<th>Slit Width (a)</th>
							<th>Wavelength (λ)</th>
							<th>Slit distance from screen (L)</th>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Specifies the slot width. For the minimum value, the occurring diffraction is the greatest, and for the maximum value, the wave bending becomes almost invisible.</td>
							<td>A physical measurement of the length of the electromagnetic wave entering the single slit. In the simulation, the shorter the wavelength, the more fringes appear on the screen. In addition, the visible color of the waves changes of course.</td>
							<td>This defines how far the waves must travel in front of the screen. In the simulation, the shorter the distance, the greater the range of the bent wave is visible on the screen.</td>
						</tr>
					</table>
					<br>
					<p>The waves visible in the simulation are only illustrative. In fact, the wavelength is too short to scale correctly with the rest of the figure. The same applies to the slit width, taking into account the slit distance from the screen, a slit created at the correct scale would not be visible in the simulation. The parameter determined in the simulation is the wave intensity, the function of which is visible on the right side of the screen. On its basis, the brightness of the fringes on the screen is determined. It is determined using the following formulas:</p>

					<h2>How to Simulate</h2>
					<p>
						1. Use the range selectors to choose desired parameters for slit width (a), wavelength of light (λ) and distance to screen (L). <br>
						2. Hit the "START" button. <br> <br>
						<i>*if the parameters are changed while the simulation is running, the changes will be reflected live onto the simulation pane.</i>

				<h1>FAQs</h1>
				<p><b>Why are there two wave fronts coming off of the single slit?</b><br>
					The two wave fronts are representant of every single wave front each particle that hits the slit produces. The two wave fronts also show how they interfere with 
					each other further as they propagate towards the screen. <br><br>
					<b>Why can you select wavelengths outside of the visible spectrum?</b><br>
					As we know the spectrum of light visible to us is between 400nm and 700nm, which corresponds to the range of colours from violet to red. Although we cannot see
					past the visible spectrum, light will still diffract, so I thought it was interesting to see how a very wide range of light interacts with the single slit and 
					what that may look like on the screen and intensity graphs. <br><br>
