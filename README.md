## „Ä∞Ô∏è Diffraction Simulator

A web based diffraction simulation for single slit interference of waves using Fraunhofer diffraction geometry. This project was created as a part of a Grade 12 AP-Physics 2 culminating task. It first outlines the history of the wave-particle model of light and how it was experimentally determined that photons behave as both a wave and as a particle when propegating through a medium. This is a simulation the diffraction of electromagnetic waves in and around the visible range of the human eye. The simulation shows the waves hitting the slit, the folding of these waves, and the image produced on the screen. The intensity as a function of angle is also plotted behind the screen.
